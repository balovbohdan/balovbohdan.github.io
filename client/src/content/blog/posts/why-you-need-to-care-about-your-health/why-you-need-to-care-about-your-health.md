Hi! I’m a Software Engineer at EPAM. I have a lot of everyday stuff related to my engineering career: coding and team leadership, intensive learning, and different activities related to setting up a passive income. If you started reading this post, I believe that you are also a hardworking and purposeful person.

Hight workload may lead to a situation that you may completely forget about your health and worsen it a lot. I mean both mental and physical health. And this is what I’ve recently recognized in my life: my health is not so good as I thought, and I need to undertake immediate actions to correct it. Familiar situation?
Now I’m in progress with setting up a plan on how to correct the stability of my mental and physical health. There are some action items I plan to use as rules for the nearest future.

### Physical health
- Keeping health in a good state is a process that requires everyday actions.
- Health is a lifestyle. You need to always remember about consequences of your actions (e.g., eating junk food).
- Healthy food! Please, stop eating junk food… Eat more fruits and vegetables every day.
- Don’t make long pauses between gyms. A gym should be like an absolute habit. Don’t think about whether you want to do a gym or not — just do it.
- Attend a doctor on a regular basis. Even if you don’t feel bad. It’s much better to prevent a possible problem rather than cure a problem that has already appeared.

### Mental health
- Keep balance. Don’t overtime.
- Read. I’m not very interested in reading books not related to software engineering. But reading even such a book helps my mind to get more relaxed.
- Don’t hurry up. You can’t become an expert in some field quickly. So, keep calm and give yourself time to gain experience.
- Enjoy the work you are doing. And change a context when you don’t feel the pleasure of your work.
- Write. This helps to organize your mind and look at yourself from aside.
- Talk to people. Meet your friends, drink coffee and discuss your lives. I recently recognized that this really helps me to get more confident in my life and aims.
- Try to live in the moment. Love your family and cherish every minute spent together.

I think I could add much more actions items. But these ones look essential for me — for my lifestyle and circumstances. Please, don’t use my rules as absolute truth. Everyone is unique.

Looks like an interesting experiment that may increase the quality of my life and speed up my success. Hope this will also help you with your healthy life. Bye!
