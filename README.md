# [Mr. Balov | Software Deveopment Blog](https://balovbohdan.github.io/)

This blog is an experiment. And I have several purposes:
- Experiment with Elm.
- Have my own space on the web to write my thoughts in a free form.
- Make first steps developing my personal brand of Software Engineer.

## Why Elm?

This is an exotic language. And I like experimenting with exotic things. Moreover, Elm is a functional lang; so, it's a good chance to get better in "real" functional programming.

## Why not Medium or something else?

Actually, I have a [Medium](https://medium.com/@balovbohdan) account. But that's not enough for me as I wanted to have my own space. Also, I like writing code and developing some "cool" things. And this blog is a good chance to write code not only for fun but for some real purpose.

## What? Personal brand?!

Yeah... Still not sure I really need this. But want to try. In any case, I do it for myself.

Let's stay in touch!
